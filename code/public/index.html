          <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed text-accent-content">Art has a special place in my heart. I started drawing before I even learned to write! Drawing my day dreams, my nighmares, my goals, my many trains of thoughts, anything and everything I saw, heard about and imagined. <br> I didn't want to mix business and pleasure so much, which is why I didn't pursue a higher education in the subject. However, in my free time I hone my skills and take on certain projects with a lot of creative freedom and super cools ideas!</p>

          </div>
          
          <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed text-accent-content">Art and computer science might have seemed miles apart decades ago, and some might consider them so still to this day, including me. I like how different they both are in terms of content and approaches. Art stimulates my creative brain, and computer science stimulates the "scienc-y" side of it. I love how both allow me to fall into the zone, wether I'm trying to figure out how to deploy through Github actions or choosing a color palette for a new project. My interest in computers was minimal from a young age, I was agile with technology, I liked learning the little tricks, tips and shortcuts but I always thought the world of computer science was out of reach for me. </p>

          <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed text-accent-content">The pandemic changed that for me, I was introduced to web development thanks to an elective class I took in my last year of bachelors, and I thought "Wow, this is what coding is!". 5 years later, here I am, graduated masters in computer science, knowing what OOP means and being able to deploy my own website and data science projects! Time is a beautiful thing, I am proud of where I stand today and I can't wait to look back in 2030</p>
