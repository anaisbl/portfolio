# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to my portfolio repo! I’m building a website to showcase my work, experiences, and projects.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2deb66-1064-404f-868a-8561f1d1563d" height="400">

### What I'm Using: :wrench:
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the website. 
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps me style the site quickly.
- **Daisy UI**: Adds ready-made UI components that work well with Tailwind CSS, so I don’t have to build everything from scratch. 

### Deployment:
I’m hosting the site on **Firebase** 🚀 and using **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment.

### Features:
- **Cute Responsive Design**: The website looks good on all devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI :blossom:
- **Projects Showcase**: You’ll find links to projects I’ve worked on, with a bit of info on each one. :memo:
- ~~**Light/Dark mode**: Turn the light on :flashlight:... or off!~~ --> decided to scrap this feature even though I was really proud of it :🥹 (13/05/2025)

### What’s Next:
- ~~**About me page**: Currently working on the about me page and restructuring home 🏠 (15/4/2025)~~ --> done 19/04/2025
- ~~Restructuring the CS page: I need to revist the layout + filter buttons and cards (19/04/2025)~~ --> done 13/05/2025
- **Re-doing the Art page**: To make it more cohesive with the other newly refreshed pages (13/05/2025)
