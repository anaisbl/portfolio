# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to my portfolio repo! Iâ€™m building a website to showcase my work, experiences, and projects.

### What I'm Using: :wrench:
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the website. 
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps me style the site quickly.
- **Daisy UI**: Adds ready-made UI components that work well with Tailwind CSS, so I donâ€™t have to build everything from scratch. 

### Deployment:
Iâ€™m hosting the site on **Firebase** ðŸš€ and using **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment.

### Why No React?
I decided not to use **React** for this project, because I don't know how :slightly_smiling_face:

### Features:
- **Cute Responsive Design**: The website looks good on all devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI :blossom:
- **Projects Showcase**: Youâ€™ll find links to projects Iâ€™ve worked on, with a bit of info on each one. :memo:
- **Light/Dark mode**: Turn the light on :flashlight:... or off!

### Whatâ€™s Next:
- **Art page**: Currently working on fleshing out the art projects page. :art:
