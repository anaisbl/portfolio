# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to my portfolio repo! I’m building a website to showcase my work, experiences, and projects.

<img src="[https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028d63d5-ff35-4cb1-81af-f34ff0b6b123]" height="400">


### What I'm Using: :wrench:
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the website. 
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps me style the site quickly.
- **Daisy UI**: Adds ready-made UI components that work well with Tailwind CSS, so I don’t have to build everything from scratch. 

### Deployment:
I’m hosting the site on **Firebase** 🚀 and using **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment.

### Why No React?
I decided not to use **React** for this project, because I don't know how :slightly_smiling_face:

### Features:
- **Cute Responsive Design**: The website looks good on all devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI :blossom:
- **Projects Showcase**: You’ll find links to projects I’ve worked on, with a bit of info on each one. :memo:
- **Light/Dark mode**: Turn the light on :flashlight:... or off!

### What’s Next:
- ~~**About me page**: Currently working on the about me page and restructuring home 🏠 (15/4/2025)~~ --> done 19/04/2025
- Restructuring the CS page: I need to revist the layout + filter buttons and cards (19/04/2025)
